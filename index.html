		<p>High Concept: Play as Dominic Toretto and collect money and give out pink slips(money) to people driving Toyota Supras. 
<p>Player Experience Goals: This game is made to get people pumped up for Furious 7, which hits theaters on April 3, 2015. Get get go when the whistle blows
When Dom collects money, he doesn't know how much he is going to get.
He will get a random amount of money added to his total amount of money.
But he will collect only between 322 and 800 dollar signs(each containing a different amount of money)
If he donates to racers in Supras, he will gain additional income
Once, you will become addicted to it.  
<p>Strategies: use up and down arrows to move the Dodge Charger 1969 to collect dollar signs and give money to racers\
You will only collect between 322 and 800 dollar signs. 
Thw game will end within that range.  
Keep yourself relaxed as you get more income.
<p>Genre: Side Scroller, Endless Runner
<p>Game play: use up and down arrows to move the car
<p>Target Audience: this game is for people who love cars and racing video games.  
For people over the age of eight. It has simple controls but has advanced mechanics. 
<p>Prototype: This game is a version of space shooter
Instead of using left, and right arrows to play.
If that were the case, the game would be too easy.

I wanted to do a minimalistic design that involved moving the car to pick up and give pink slips to racers who are stalled.  
<p>Setting/Premise: takes place in an Umbrella Corporation facility that deals with human organs for cash.
<p>Story: Dominic Toretto has fallen into a dream after Brian's death. He gets flashbacks after seeing those Toyota Supras because
Brian drove that car.  Dom fights for his life in the dream, trying to be as rich as he can.  What he gets in that dream comes to his income in real life.
<p>Prototype Assets: From Google images, modified in Piskel. Made my own background 
Used real Dodge Charger engine sounds for the car.
<p>Prototype Closest Other Game: Borrowed from space shooter and modified it.
